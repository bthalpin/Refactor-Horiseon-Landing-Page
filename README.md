# Refactoring of Horiseon Landing Page
The Horiseon Marketing Agency needed me to refactor their web application to conform to accessibilty standards to ensure their site was optimized for search engines.

I accomplished this by adding semantic elements, a descriptive title, and alt properties for the images.  I also fixed a broken link, consolodated the css file, and added comments to both the html and css files to improve the long-tem sustainabilty of the codebase.
